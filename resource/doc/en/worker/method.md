# Interfaces

Workerman provides multiple interfaces for developers to use for different purposes. These interfaces include WebSocket, HTTP, TCP, and custom protocols.

## WebSocket

Workerman provides a convenient WebSocket server implementation that allows developers to easily build real-time web applications. The WebSocket interface supports full-duplex communication and is ideal for applications that require instant data exchange.

## HTTP

The HTTP interface allows developers to create high-performance, asynchronous, and event-driven web applications. With the HTTP interface, developers can build web services, APIs, and web applications that handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.

## TCP

With the TCP interface, developers can build custom network protocols and applications that require low-level access to network communication. Workerman's TCP interface supports both IPv4 and IPv6 and provides a flexible solution for building various network applications.

## Custom Protocols

Developers can also define and implement custom protocols using Workerman, allowing for highly specialized and tailored communication between clients and servers.

By providing these interfaces, Workerman offers a versatile and powerful framework for developing a wide range of network applications.
