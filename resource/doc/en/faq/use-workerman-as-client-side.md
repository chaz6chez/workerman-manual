# Can workerman act as a client to receive and process data from a remote server?

Workerman can initiate asynchronous connections using AsyncTcpConnection to interact as a client with a server.

For example, refer to the following examples:

1. [Workerman as a websocket client](as-wss-client.md)
2. [Workerman as a mysql proxy](../async-tcp-connection/connect.md)
3. [Workerman as an http client](../async-tcp-connection/construct.md)
4. [Workerman as an http proxy](https://github.com/walkor/php-http-proxy)
5. [Workerman as a socks5 proxy](https://github.com/walkor/php-socks5)
