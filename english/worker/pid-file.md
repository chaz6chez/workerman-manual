# pidFile
## Description:
```php
static string Worker::$pidFile
```

It is recommended not to set this property unless necessary.

This is a global static property used to set the file path for the WorkerMan process pid.

This setting is useful for monitoring. For example, placing the WorkerMan pid file in a fixed directory can make it easier for some monitoring software to read the pid file and monitor the WorkerMan process status.

If not set, WorkerMan will, by default, generate a pid file at a location parallel to the Workerman directory (note that before workerman 3.2.3, the default location was ```sys_get_temp_dir()```) and, in order to avoid conflicts when starting multiple WorkerMan instances, the pid file generated by WorkerMan includes the current WorkerMan's path.

Note: This property must be set before ```Worker::runAll();``` is called to be effective. This feature is not supported on Windows systems.


## Example
```php
use Workerman\Worker;
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

Worker::$pidFile = '/var/run/workerman.pid';

$worker = new Worker('text://0.0.0.0:8484');
$worker->onWorkerStart = function($worker)
{
    echo "Worker start";
};
// Run the worker
Worker::runAll();
```
