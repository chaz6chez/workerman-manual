# Development and Deployment of Workerman on Windows and Linux

**Question:**

I have developed a simple instant messaging tool using workerman-chat on Windows. Now I want to deploy it on a Linux environment. What should I do?

**Answer:**

There are two methods:

1. Download the Linux version of workerman-chat and replace the files in your Applications directory.
2. Simply replace the Workerman directory with the Linux version of Workerman.

The second method applies to all cases where a Windows version needs to be ported to a Linux system.
