# Workerman 5.0 Features and Changes

## Installation
```bash
composer require workerman/workerman ^5.0.0-beta.2
```

> **Note**
> Workerman v5 requires php>=8.1

# Support for Fiber Coroutines
See [Fiber Coroutines](../fiber.md)

# Timer::sleep()
The Workerman core has added the `Timer::sleep(float $delay)` method, which makes the current coroutine sleep for a fixed number of seconds (without blocking the current process).

> **Note**
> This feature requires installing `composer require revolt/event-loop ^1.0.0`, or using Swoole/Swow as the event-driven solution.

# workerman/http-client Supports Fiber Coroutines
See the manual [workerman/http-client](../components/workerman-http-client.md)

# workerman/redis Supports Fiber Coroutines
See the manual [workerman/redis](../components/workerman-redis.md)

> **Note**
> Intranet, especially local Redis calls, are very fast. Therefore, in most cases, using multiple processes + Redis extension provides the best performance, and there is no need to use `workerman/redis` or other coroutine Redis clients.

# Support for Swoole as the Underlying Event-Driven Mechanism
See the manual [Coroutines-Swoole as Event-Driven Mechanism](../fiber.md)

# WebSocket Handshake
Workerman v5 has changed the parameter types for the onWebSocketConnect callback, removing support for `$_SERVER`, `$_GET`, and other superglobal variables.

**Before Workerman v5**
```php
<?php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Workerman\Connection\TcpConnection;
use Workerman\Worker;

$worker = new Worker('websocket://0.0.0.0:8181');
$worker->onWebSocketConnect = function(TcpConnection $connection, string $httpBuffer) {
    // Validating the connection source can be done here, and if it's not valid, the connection can be closed
    // $_SERVER['HTTP_ORIGIN'] indicates which site's page initiated the websocket connection
    if ($_SERVER['HTTP_ORIGIN'] != 'https://www.workerman.net') {
        $connection->close();
    }
    // $_GET and $_SERVER are available in onWebSocketConnect
    // var_dump($_GET, $_SERVER);
};
$worker->onMessage = static function($connection, $request) {};
```

**After Workerman v5**
```php
<?php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Workerman\Connection\TcpConnection;
use Workerman\Protocols\Http\Request;
use Workerman\Worker;

$worker = new Worker('websocket://0.0.0.0:12345');
$worker->onWebSocketConnect = function (TcpConnection $connection, Request $request) {
    if ($request->header('origin') != 'https://www.workerman.net') {
        $connection->close();
    }
    var_dump($request->get());
    var_dump($request->header());
};
$worker->onMessage = static function($connection, $request) {};

Worker::runAll();
```
